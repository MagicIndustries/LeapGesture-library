  abstract = {The use of gesture as a natural interface serves as a motivating force for research in modeling, analyzing and recognition of gestures. In particular, human computer intelligent interaction needs vision-based gesture recognition, which involves many interdisciplinary studies. A survey on recent vision-based gesture recognition approaches is given in this paper. We shall review methods of static hand posture and temporal gesture recognition. Several application systems of gesture recognition are also described in this paper. We conclude with some thoughts about future research directions.},

abstract ={A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known‚Äîa collaboration network and a food web‚Äîand find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},
