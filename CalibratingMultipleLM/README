Program used to calibrate multiple Leap Motion devices
The program's input is the file calib.txt containing information about calibration points.
The calib.txt has a structure:

	numberOfCalibrationPairs
	x y z x2 y2 z2
	x y z x2 y2 z2
	...
	x y z x2 y2 z2

where the first line contains the number of corresponding points. In the 
next line the correspondences are listed. The first 3 values are the
position in the coordinate system of 1st Leap Motion, while the remaining
3 values are the position in CS of the 2nd Leap Motion.

The program returns the transformation matrix between CS of Leap Motions.
The program also returns the RMS informing about the precision of the calibration.

To run the program go to the build directory:

	cd build

Then call the cmake:

	cmake ..
	
And then you can build the program and run it:
	
	make -j2
	./calib
