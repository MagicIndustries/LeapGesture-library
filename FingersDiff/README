SVM_static needs libsvm library, which can be downloaded from:
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/

For ubuntu or archlinux there is "libsvm" package to install

Right now the program classifies data into n clusters and is run by:
./SVMstatic file.lmr file2.lmr file3.lmr ...
where file.lmr contains data for 1 set of gestures

50% of data is used for learning, 50% of data is used to validate the computed model

After defining the features, the learning takes ~20min. In the end program returns the recognition rate in %.
